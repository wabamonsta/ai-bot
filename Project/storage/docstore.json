NFT stands for Non-fungible Token. Fungible by its\nvery definition means something that is mutually\ninterchangeable . For example, you can exchange a $10 note with\nanother $10 note or exchange it with two $5 notes. In both cases, the\nvalue remains the same and you will have no problem exchanging the\nmoney. Here, money is a fungible item as it can be exchanged without\ndiminishing the value.\nThe Mona Lisa / Source: Wikipedia\nSo when we say Non-fungible, it means something that can\u2019t  be\nexchanged with a similar item of similar value.

And\nmore importantly, will it hold the same value? The answer is no. Here,\nthe incomparable Mona Lisa painting is a Non-fungible item\nthat can\u2019t be exchanged with another item having an identical\nappearance.\nUniqueness is the key here. A Non-fungible item is, therefore,\nsomething that is unique and authentic. Something that holds value for\nits authenticity. Now we come to the token part. A token is a 40-\ndigit string  of words and numbers that hold the information of the\noriginal artist who created the masterpiece, the current owner of the\nitem (it can only be one), and the current price of the item. This storage\nof information is backed by Blockchain technology which can\u2019t be\naltered by any means due to its decentralized system.\nSour ce fr om\nAlibaba.comVisit Site\nAlibaba.com\ue80a\n03/05/2023, 14:18 NFTs Explained: What is an NFT  and What is Its Use | Beebom\nhttps://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/ 4/19\nFinally, when you put all three words together, NFT means an\nincorruptible token that holds ownership information about an item\nthat is unique and authentic. NFT is basically a certificate of\nownership or authenticity . This is the general definition of NFT,\nbut if you want to get a complete idea about NFTs then you need to\nunderstand the concept with digital art as an example, which I have\ncovered in the next section.\nWhat is the Use of NFT in Digital Art?\nMany must be wondering what is the use of NFT in digital art and why\nis there so much hullabaloo about it? Well, as I explained in the above\nsection that NFT is a signature of authenticity and it provides that\nauthentic stamp of approval on the web while dealing with digital arts.\nWe all know, in today\u2019s world anything can be tampered with and\npeople can pass off others\u2019 work as theirs. Basically, on the web, it\u2019s\nnext to impossible to find the original creator  of an artwork and\nthat\u2019s where NFTs come into the play.

The\ndigital art is called \u201cEverydays \u2013 The First 5000 Days\u201d was made by\nMike Winkelmann who goes by the name of Beeple. The digital image\nwas sold for $69 million and the buyer got a 319MB digital file\n(JPEG image) along with the NFT (token)  which holds the\ninformation about its ownership, et al.\nThe thing about NFT is that it\u2019s no longer just limited to\npaintings , but now people are using it to buy digital collectibles of all\nkinds. For example, Jack Dorsey  has started an NFT auction about his\nfirst tweet which currently holds the value of $2.5 million. Similarly,\nKings of Leon  \u2014 a rockband \u2014 has announced that their new music\nalbum will be released with NFT. Strangely, the Nyan Cat GIF  has been\nsold for $587,000 with NFT and many new NFT marketplaces have\nopened up such as OpenSea , CryptoPunks , etc. that sell digital\ncollectible with NFTs. It\u2019s still a niche market, but growing rapidly in\nthe crypto world.\nHow is Blockchain Related to NFT?\nI have explained above that Blockchain technology is the bedrock on\nwhich NFT is built.

In this\ngame, players could purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats using\nEther (Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency). At that time, the highest-selling cat\nwas sold at $117,712 which was mind-boggling. Getting a cue,\nEthereum incorporated the NFT system into its cryptocurrency and\nnow they are leading the market.\nTo give you some numbers, in 2018, NFT had a total market share of\n$50 million; in 2019, it reached around $150 million and in 2020, the\nNFT market ballooned to a massive $338 million . Now with the\ncurrent boom, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where the market will go from here.\nThe Cons of NFT\nWhile we discussed the pros of NFT from above and beyond, there are\nsome major cons that you should keep in mind before investing in a\ndigital collectible through NFT. First off, it takes up an enormous\namount of energy to generate and maintain the system which makes it\nunsustainable and makes a negative impact on the ecology . It\u2019s\nbecause, unlike cryptocurrency, a non-fungible token runs on a proof-\nof-work blockchain which is less energy-efficient. As an aside, expect\nGPU prices to go even higher in the near future due to extreme mining.\ue80a\n03/05/2023, 14:18 NFTs Explained: What is an NFT  and What is Its Use | Beebom\nhttps://beebom.com/what-is-nft-explained/ 9/19\nApart from that, critics warn that NFT is a bubble, and people who are\nbuying a strange GIF or collecting a rare video clip at such a high cost\nwill come crashing down. Experts say that paintings and rare\ncollectibles do not hold value just because of the sheer artistry, but also\nbecause there is an established audience who want to own and\ncollect rare paintings  or an artwork that no other person has.\nExperts point out that those who are buying digital artwork are not\npaying huge sums because they appreciate art. Instead, they want to\ncreate a bubble to earn money by reselling it at a higher price.

However, there are certain things you need to\ntake into consideration before you make your first NFT purchase.\nFirst, you need to ensure that you have a crypto wallet that supports\nNFTs. Second, you need to see which marketplace you want to buy\nfrom, as well as the cryptocurrency required to purchase the NFT\nyou\u2019re interested in. For example, while Ethereum (ETH) is one of the\nleading players in NFTs, there are marketplaces that use other\ncryptocurrencies as well. So make sure you have enough of the\ncurrency to pay for your desired unique piece of digital art.\nSome of the NFT marketplaces you can check out are OpenSea, Rarible,\nMintable, Nifty Gateway (this is the one Grimes sold her video on), and\nothers.\nHow to Sell NFTs\nIf you\u2019re the owner of a piece of digital art or any other content that you\nwant to sell as an NFT, you can do the same on NFT marketplaces as\nwell.

However,\ndo note that some marketplaces have fees that they will charge you for\nhosting and selling your NFT. So make sure that you read the fine print\nwell, before choosing the marketplace you want to sell your NFT on.\nHow to Make NFTs\nMaking NFTs is fairly straightforward once you\u2019re done with the initial\nset up. The difficult part is actually figuring out the rest of the stuff.\nBasically, you will need a wallet that can be used with NFTs, such as\nMetaMask.\nOnce you\u2019ve created your wallet, you can connect it to the platform\nwhere you want to sell your art (such as OpenSea, Rarible, etc). Now,\nyou can upload your digital piece of art to the platform, choose a price\nfor it, and start an auction.\nHowever, things are slightly complicated. In Rarible, for example, you\nwill have to pay a small fee to list your art. Further, you will have to pay\nadditional money to get your art converted into an NFT, and then, once\nyour NFT is sold, Rarible will also charge you a commission, as well as\nsome money for transferring the cryptocurrency from the buyer\u2019s\nwallet to yours.\nOverall, making a non-fungible token art is easy, but selling it involves\na bit of work.
